## Hi there, I'm Samer ðŸ‘‹

I'm a recent graduate from McGill University with a Bachelor's in Software Engineering.

I've been enjoying web development ever since I built my capstone project for my undergrad, a web version of the board game "Splendor". Since then, I've embarked on learning Go for backend web development, which has become my favourite language for backend development.

I'm currently looking for a role in backend web development, preferably writing Go or Python. I'd love to work in a small team where I can contribute to exciting projects and make a significant impact on the project. If you're hiring, let's chat!
