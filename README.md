## Hi there, I'm Samer 👋

I'm a Software Developer based in Montreal with a Bachelor's in Software Engineering from McGill University.

I specialize in backend development and API integrations, with professional experience building webhook processing systems, OAuth flows, and subscription management platforms. I'm particularly drawn to Go for its simplicity and performance, though I work across the full stack when needed.

Recently, I worked at NetRevenue where I built integrations for GoHighLevel, Calendly, Stripe, and Zoom, processing 10k+ API calls daily and improving system reliability through distributed systems debugging. Before that, I worked on AI-powered code review tools at TheDevFactory.

In my free time, I build side projects like Bookmarkd, a full-stack book club app with a Go backend and PostgreSQL database.

I'm currently exploring new opportunities and always open to collaborating on interesting projects. If you're building something cool, let's connect!
