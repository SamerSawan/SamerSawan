## Hi there, I'm Samer ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Software Developer based in Montreal with a Bachelorâ€™s in Software Engineering from McGill University.  

My journey into development started with my capstone project, a web version of the board game *Splendor*. Since then, Iâ€™ve explored everything from hackathons and game jams to building full-stack projects like **Bookmarkd**, a book club app. Along the way, Iâ€™ve grown a strong passion for backend development â€” especially with **Go**, for its simplicity and performance.  

Currently, Iâ€™m working at **NetRevenue**, contributing to **Salesvue.io**, a sales engagement platform where I build backend services, integrate third-party services, and design scalable solutions.  

Iâ€™m always excited to learn, collaborate, and contribute to impactful projects. If youâ€™re working on something cool, letâ€™s connect!
