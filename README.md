## Hi there, I'm Samer ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a recent graduate from McGill University with a Bachelorâ€™s in Software Engineering.

My journey into web development started with my capstone project, a web version of the board game "Splendor." Since then, Iâ€™ve embarked on a journey with Go for backend developmentâ€”its simplicity and performance make it my favorite tool to build with.

Iâ€™m currently on the look out for a role in backend web development, ideally working with Go or Python. Iâ€™d especially love to join a small, close-knit team where I can contribute to exciting projects and make an impact quickly. If that sounds like you're hiring, letâ€™s connect! You can reach me at me@samersawan.com.
