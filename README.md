## Hi there, I'm Samer ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Software Developer based in Montreal with a Bachelorâ€™s in Software Engineering from McGill University.

Iâ€™ve been building software for a long time, everything from hackathon prototypes and game jam experiments to full-stack applications like Bookmarkd, a book club app for tracking and sharing reads. Over time, Iâ€™ve grown a particular passion for backend development, especially working with Go for its simplicity and performance.

Currently, I work at NetRevenue, contributing to Salesvue.io
, a sales engagement platform. There, I build full-stack features â€” from backend services and third-party integrations to frontend components and user-facing tools.

Iâ€™m always excited to learn, collaborate, and work on impactful projects. If youâ€™re building something interesting, letâ€™s connect!
